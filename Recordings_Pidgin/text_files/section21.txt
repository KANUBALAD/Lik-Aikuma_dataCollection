E be like sey na Capernaum Jesus dey when e condemn the Pharisees. ## .
Later that day, e comot for house, come go the Sea of Galilee. ## .
For there, plenty people gather am. ## .
Jesus come enter one boat. When the boat don enter the water small, e start to teach dem about the Kingdom wey dey heaven. ## .
E use many example or story teach dem. The people know many of the things wey Jesus take do example. ## .
This one really make truth about God Kingdom easy for dem to understand. ## .
The first story wey Jesus talk na about one farmer wey dey plant seed. ## .
Some of the seed fall for corner of road and bird chop dem. ## .
Some still fall for ground wey stone full.  ## .
Them start to grow but their root no see enough sand to enter. ## .
So when sun beat the plants, dem come die. ## .
Some seed still fall for where chuku-chuku dey. ## .
When this ones start to grow, the chuku-chuku kill dem. ## .
Finally, some seed fall for better ground.  ## .
This seeds come produce well well, “this one 100 times, that one 60, the other 30.”. ## .
For another story, Jesus sey the Kingdom be like when farmer dey plant seed. ## .
But for this one, whether the man sleep o, or e no sleep, the seed must grow. ## .
How e take happen, “e no know.”. ## .
Dem grow by theirself and produce fruit wey e fit harvest. ## .
Jesus still talk another story about person wey dey plant seed. ## .
This time, the man plant better seed, but “when people dey sleep,” one enemy come plant grass join the wheat. ## .
The man servants ask am whether make dem uproot the grass. ## .
But e tell dem sey: “No, because by mistake, una fit uproot the wheat as una dey uproot  the grass. ## .
Leave dem make dem grow together until the harvest season. ## .
And for the harvest season, I go tell the people wey go harvest am sey:. ## .
Make una first comot the grass and tie dem separate separate to burn dem. ## .
after make una gather the wheat put inside my storehouse.”. ## .
Many people wey dey listen to Jesus know about farm work. ## .
And e still talk another thing wey the people still know na the small seed wey dem dey call mustard seed. ## .
When this seed grow, e go be big tree wey birds fit stay for im branch. ## .
Jesus talk sey: “The Kingdom wey dey heaven be like mustard seed wey one man collect, come plant am for im farm.”. ## .
But Jesus no dey teach people how to plant mustard seed. ## .
But, e use this story teach dem sey something wey small well well fit grow or expand well well. ## .
The next thing wey Jesus talk about na something wey many of the people know. ## .
E sey the Kingdom wey dey heaven be like ‘yeast wey one woman collect come use am mix three big container of flour.’. ## .
After person mix yeast with flour, e no go fit see the yeast again. ## .
But the yeast go enter every part of the flour and e go make am rise. ## .
So yeast dey make something change and increase even though sey people no dey quick notice am. ## .
After Jesus talk all this example, e come tell the people make dem go, and e go back to the house wey e dey stay. ## .
E no tey, im disciples come meet am. ## .
Dem want understand the meaning of this things. ## .
Im disciples don hear am before when e use story teach, but e never teach dem with this kind plenty story at once. ## .
Na im make dem ask am sey: “Why you dey use story teach dem?”. ## .
One reason why Jesus use story teach people na because, e want do wetin Bible don talk.## .
Matthew write sey: “E no go teach without story, so that e go do wetin the prophet talk wey sey:. ## .
‘Na story I go use dey talk; I go talk wetin people never know since dem make this world.’”. ## .
But e get other things wey make Jesus dey use story teach people. ## .
E dey make people show their real character. ## .
Many people dey follow Jesus because e sabi talk story well well, and e dey do miracle. ## .
Dem no dey see Jesus as Lord wey dem suppose follow and obey with all their heart. ## .
Dem no want change the way dem dey think, and the way dem dey do things. ## .
Dem no even want make Jesus message touch their heart. ## .
Jesus answer the question wey im disciples ask. ## .
E sey: “Na im make I dey use story dey teach dem; because dem dey look, but dem no dey see. ## .
Their ear open, but dem dey hear for nothing, and dem no dey understand am.  ## .
Wetin prophet Isaiah talk dey happen to dem sey:. ## .
Nothing dey enter this people heart again. ## . 
Jesus dey explain to im disciples the story of seed wey fall for different ground. ## .
This thing wey Jesus talk no concern people wey really dey listen to am. ## .
Jesus explain why. E sey: “Una dey happy because una eye dey see, and una ear dey hear. ## .
Na true I dey tell una, many prophet and righteous people really get the mind to see the things wey una dey see. ## .
but dem no fit, and to hear wetin una dey hear now, but dem no fit. ## .
The 12 apostles and other disciples wey be Jesus tight friend, really get better mind. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey:. ## .
“Na una dem give the opportunity  to understand the holy secret about the Kingdom wey dey heaven, but e no reach their hand. ## .
Jesus see sey the disciples really want understand wetin e talk. ## .
So e come explain the story about the farmer to dem. ## .
Jesus tell dem sey, ‘the seed na God word. ## .
And the ground wey the seed fall put na people heart. ## .
This thing wey Jesus talk go help person know the meaning of the story. ## .
Jesus come explain the meaning of the seed wey fall for corner of the road wey people dey march. ## .
E sey: “Devil come comot wetin dem don hear from their mind make dem no believe, so that dem no go save.”. ## .
When Jesus talk about the seed wey fall for ground wey stone dey, e dey talk about people wey happy when dem hear the word, but e no enter their heart well.  ## .
So when wahala and suffer come because of God word, dem come fall. ## .
True true, “when problem come,” like when people for their family and other people dey give dem problem, dem stop to dey follow Jesus. ## .
What about the seed wey fall for where chuku-chuku dey? . ## .
Jesus tell im disciples sey this ones na people wey hear the word. ## .
But “the wahala wey dey this world and the way money fit deceive people, no let the word grow” for their heart. ## .
Even though sey dem hear the word and e enter their heart, e no fit grow or produce fruit. ## .
The last type of ground wey Jesus talk about na better ground. ## .
This one stand for people wey hear the word of God and dem accept am, and dem use all their heart understand am. ## .
Wetin come happen? Dem “produce fruit.”. ## .
This people get different condition for life. ## .
Some fit don old  or dey sick, so all of dem no go fit produce the same amount.  ## .
One fit produce reach 100 times, another one go produce reach 60 times, and another one go produce reach 30 times. ## .
The truth be sey, the people wey God go bless ‘na people wey hear the message with better mind, and dem no leave am. ## .
And because dem endure, dem come fit produce fruit. ## .
