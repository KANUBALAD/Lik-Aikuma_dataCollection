The next thing wey Jesus talk about na how to treat people. ## .
E sey Everything wey una want make people do una. ## .
make una do am to dem. ## .
This na better advice wey we suppose remember. ## .
when we dey do things with other people. ## .
But e fit no easy to do am. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey. ## .
Make una enter from the narrow gate. ## .
Because  the wide gate and the road. ## .
wey get space well well dey lead to destruction. ## .
and na many people dey follow the road. ## .
But the narrow gate and the road wey tight. ## .
dey lead to life. ## .
and people wey dey follow the road no plenty. ## .
Some people go try to comot. ## .
the disciples mind from the road wey lead to life. ## .
Na im make Jesus warn dem sey. ## .
Make una sofri because fake prophet. ## .
go use sheep body cover theirself come meet una. ## .
but for inside dem be dangerous wolves. ## .
Jesus talk sey na fruit dem take dey know good tree and bad tree. ## .
Na so e still be with people. ## .
Na wetin dem dey teach and wetin dem dey do. ## .
we go use take know fake prophets. ## .
Jesus talk sey no be only wetin person talk. ## .
go show sey e be Jesus disciple. ## .
wetin e dey do go still show am. ## .
Many people talk sey Jesus na their Lord. ## .
but dem no dey do wetin God want. ## .
Jesus talk sey I go tell dem sey. ## .
I no know una. ## .
Make una comot for my front una wey dey do rubbish. ## .
To end im sermon Jesus sey. ## .
So everybody wey hear all this things wey I dey talk so. ## .
and e come do dem go be like wise man wey build im house ontop rock. ## .
When heavy rain fall flood come. ## .
and heavy breeze blow the house. ## .
but e no fall because na on top rock e dey. ## .
Wetin make the house no fall. ## .
Na because the man make. ## .
the foundation of the house deep and e build am ontop rock. ## .
So we no go only hear wetin Jesus teach. ## .
Instead we must use all our mind do am. ## .
What of person wey dey hear the things. ## .
Jesus talk but e no dey do dem. ## .
E go be like â€œfoolish man wey build im house ontop sand. ## .
Rain flood and breeze go scatter that kind house fall. ## .
The people surprise for the way Jesus take teach the sermon. ## .
E no teach dem the way the leaders for Jew religion dey do. ## .
But e teach dem like person wey get authority. ## .
E be like sey many of the people wey listen to am become im disciples. ## .
Sometimes Jesus dey repeat important things when e dey teach. ## .
For example for the Sermon on the Mount. ## .
e teach people how to pray. ## .
and e let dem know the correct mind for money and property. ## .
About one year and six months later. ## .
Jesus talk this things again. ## .
Some people fit no dey when Jesus talk am the first time. ## .
When Jesus enter Jerusalem. ## .
noise and confusion full the whole city. ## .
as dem dey sey Who be this. ## .
The crowd come dey talk sey. ## .
This na the prophet Jesus wey come from Nazareth wey dey Galilee. ## .
People for the crowd wey see Jesus when e resurrect Lazarus. ## .
come dey tell other people about the miracle. ## .
Pharisee people come dey complain sey Jesus don put sand sand for their garri. ## .
Dem tell each other sey The whole world don follow am. ## .
As e dey always do when e visit Jerusalem. ## .
Jesus enter the temple go teach. ## .
For there e cure blind people and cripple. ## .
When the chief priests and the scribes see wetin e dey do. ## .
and the way the boys for the temple dey shout. ## .
We pray make you save Son of David. ## .
dem come dey vex. ## .
The leaders for religion ask Jesus sey. ## .
You dey hear wetin this boys dey talk. ## .
Jesus answer dem sey. ## .
Una never read am sey. ## .
small children and pikin dem go praise God. ## .
Jesus come look everything wey dey happen for the temple. ## .
Now time don go so e comot with im disciples. ## .
Before Nisan 10 start. ## .
e go back to Bethany and e spend Sunday night for there. ## .
so this one na better chance for dem to gain from wetin Jesus dey teach. ## .
And e still make am easy for im disciples to remember the important things. ## .
