How you value your property reach. ## .
Jesus tell the people sey. ##
Make una stop to dey gather things for unaself for this earth. ## .
where insect and rust fit spoil am. ## .
and where thief fit enter come thief am. ## .
Wetin Jesus talk really correct. ## .
Property wey we get fit spoil. ## .
and sey we get dem no mean sey God go like us. ## .
Jesus come sey Keep better thing for yourself for heaven. ## .
We fit do this one if God na number one for our life.  ## .
Nobody fit spoil our friendship with God. ## .
and nobody fit collect the life wey God don promise us. ## .
So na true Jesus talk when e sey. ## .
Where your property dey. ## .
na there your mind go still dey. ## .
Jesus use one example to make dem understand this matter. ## .
E sey Na the eye be the lamp for the whole body. ## .
so if you put eye straight for one thing. ## .
your whole body go bright. ## .
But if your eye dey for plenty things. ## .
your whole body go dark. ## .
Eye wey dey work well be like light. ## .
wey dey make our body shine. ## .
For am to be like that we must put eye for one thing. ## .
If not we no go see things for this life. ## .
the way we suppose see am again. ## .
If we put mind for property pass God. ## .
our whole body go dark. ## .
This one mean sey we fit start to dey play wayo or do bad things. ## .
Jesus give one better example. ## .
nobody fit be slave for two oga. ## .
E go either hate one and love the other one. ## .
or e go hold one tight and leave the other one. ## .
Una no fit be slave to God and to money. ## .
Some people wey dey listen to Jesus. ## .
fit want know the correct thing to do about things wey dem need for life. ## .
So Jesus promise dem sey. ## .
if na God be number one for their life. ## .
dem no need  to worry. ## .
E talk sey Make una look the bird wey dey fly for up. ## .
dem no dey plant seed and dem no dey harvest put for inside store. ## .
but una Father wey dey heaven still dey give dem food. ## .
What of the fine fine flower wey dey grow for the mountain. ## .
Jesus talk sey Even as Solomon get honor reach. ## .
im cloth no dey fine reach any of this flower. ## .
Wetin this one mean. ## .
Flower wey dey today tomorrow dem go throw am for oven. ## .
but God make am fine. ## .
You no think sey God go still take care of you. ## .
Jesus come give dem one better advice. ## .
Make una no dey worry and sey. ## .
Wetin we go chop. ## .
or Wetin we go drink. ## .
or Wetin we go wear. ## .
Your Father wey dey heaven know sey. ## .

So make una continue to dey find the Kingdom. ## .
and im righteousness first and. ## .
e go add all this other things join for una. ## .
how t get life. ## .
The apostles and other people wey get good heart. ## .
want live the kind life wey go make God happy. ## .
but somethings dey make am hard for dem.  ## .
For example many Pharisee dey find fault. ## .
and dey use wicked mind judge people. ## .
Jesus advice people wey dey listen to am sey. ## .
Stop to dey judge people. ## .
so that dem no go judge una. ## .
because na the way una judge people dem go judge una. ## .
Jesus show sey na bad thing to dey copy. ## .
the way Pharisee people dey condemn people e talk sey. ## .
Blind person go fit show another blind person road. ## .
The two of dem no go fall inside pit. ## .
