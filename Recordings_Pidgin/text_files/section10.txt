Why e be sey plenty money enjoyment and praise. ## .
from people dey bring wahala. ## .
Na because when person get this things and value dem. ## .
e fit no remember to serve God well again. ## .
That one no go make am get real happiness. ## .
Jesus no dey talk sey poverty or hunger dey make person happy. ## .
But most times na poor people dey obey wetin Jesus talk. ## .
and na dem God dey bless with real happiness. ## .
The next thing wey Jesus talk na for im disciples. ## .
E sey Na una be the salt for this earth. ## .
Jesus disciples no be ordinary salt. ## .
Dem dey put salt for some things so that dem no go quick spoil. ## .
For God temple dem dey keep plenty salt near the altar. ## .
And dem dey put am for sacrifice. ## .
For Bible salt fit still mean sey something dey pure and e no spoil. ## .
Jesus disciples na salt for this earth. ## .
because dem dey help people get better character. ## .
and be Jehovah friend. ## .
Their message fit save anybody wey listen to dem. ## .
Jesus still tell im disciple sey. ## .
Na una be the light for this world. ## .
Person no dey use basket cover lamp. ## .
e dey put the light where e go shine. ## . 
So Jesus sey Make una light shine for where people dey. ## .
so that dem go see una fine work and praise the Father wey dey heaven. ## .
Jesus shhow im disciplies the correct way. ## . 
E never tey wey leaders for Jew people religion. ## .
plan to kill Jesus because dem see am as person wey no dey obey God law. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey. ## .
No think sey I come destroy the Law or the Prophets. ## .
I no come destroy am but I come do wetin e talk. ## .
The truth be sey na Jesus respect God law pass. ## .
and e tell people sey make dem dey respect am. ## .
E even talk sey If anybody no obey any of  the commandment. ## .
wey small pass and e come dey teach other people to do like am. ## .
na im go small pass for the Kingdom wey dey heaven. ## .
Wetin Jesus mean be sey that kind person no go near God Kingdom at all. ## .
Jesus still sey But if anybody obey the commandment. ## .
and still teach people to obey am. ## .
e go be big person for the Kingdom wey dey heaven. ## .
Jesus even talk sey e bad for person to get character. ## .
wey fit make am no obey God law. ## .
After Jesus don quote the law. ## .
wey sey make we no ever kill e talk sey. ##. 
Anybody wey continue to dey vex for im brother. ## .
go face judgement for court. ## .
Na really serious matter if person no stop to dey vex. ## .
for another person. ## .
E fit even make am kill the person. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey we must try to make sure sey peace dey. ## .
E sey: â€œIf as you want come give something for altar. ## .
and for there you come remember sey your brother dey vex for you. ## .
leave wetin you want give for the front of altar. ## .
make you first go settle with am. ## .
before you go come give God the thing. ## .
Another commandment for the Law show sey e bad for person. ## .
to sleep with who no be im husband or wife.  ## .
Jesus talk sey Una hear this thing wey dem talk sey. ## .
Make you no sleep with person wey no be your wife or husband. ## .
But I dey tell una sey. ## .
Any man wey dey look woman sotey e want sleep with am. ## .
that man don already sleep with am for im heart. ## .
Jesus no dey talk about bad thing wey just pass person mind. ## .
But e dey talk sey na serious matter. ## .
if person no stop to dey look. ## .
If person too dey look another person. ## .
e fit start to dey like the person. ## .
And if e see chance e fit go sleep with am. ## .
Wetin person go do make this kind thing no happen. ## .
Wetin e need to do really dey serious.  ## .
Jesus sey If your right eye dey make you fall. ## .
pull am comot and trowey am. ## .
If your right hand dey make you fall cut am comot and trowey am. ## .
