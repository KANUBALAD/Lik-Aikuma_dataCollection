200703-194916_pcm_65e_elicit_22:So if we collect all the story wey the four of dem write we go fit know everything wey the teacher talk and do
200703-194916_pcm_65e_elicit_23:This example show us sey e make sense as four people write Jesus story

200703-194916_pcm_65e_elicit_35:The truth of the matter be sey everything wey dey inside the four gospels or the good news na about Jesus
200703-194916_pcm_65e_elicit_36:Many people wey dey study God Word don compare the things wey Matthew Mark Luke and John write and dem don try see if dem match
