After Jesus stay two days for Samaria, e come go im hometown. ## .
Even though sey e don preach well well for Judea, e no dey go Galilee go rest. ## .
But e want go preach even more for the area where e grow. ## .
E fit be sey Jesus no dey expect sey dem go welcome am well, because Jesus imself talk am sey, “dem no dey respect prophet for im hometown.”. ## .
When dem reach Galilee, im disciples go back to their family and the work wey dem dey do before. ## .
Wetin Jesus start to preach about? Na about the Kingdom, e sey. ## .
the Kingdom of God don near. ## .
Repent, and get faith for the good news.”. ## . 
Wetin the people come do? The truth be sey, many people for Galilee welcome Jesus well and dem respect am. ## .
No be because of the message wey e dey preach, but because some of dem dey the Passover wey dem do for Jerusalem and dem see the miracle wey Jesus do. ## .
Where for Galilee Jesus start this big preaching work? . ## .
E clear sey na for Cana, where e turn water to wine for one marriage. ## .
As e come this second time, e hear sey one small boy dey sick and e go soon die. ## .
The boy papa dey work for King Herod wey later kill John the Baptist. ## .
As the boy papa hear sey Jesus don come Cana, e come travel from Capernaum where e dey live, go find Jesus for Cana. ## .
With the pain wey full im heart, e beg Jesus sey, “Oga, make you come before my pikin die.”. ## .
Jesus talk wetin surprise the man, e sey: “Make you dey go, your son dey alive.”. ## .
The man believe Jesus and e come dey go house. ## .
For road e meet im slaves wey dey run come tell am the good news. ## .
True true, im pikin don well, and e dey alive!. ## .
Na im e ask dem sey: ‘Which time e well?’. ## .
E dey ask so that e go know the exact time. ## .
Dem tell am sey ‘na yesterday around 1 o’clock for afternoon.’. ## .
The man slaves run come meet am as e dey come back to im pikin wey Jesus heal. ## .
The man come see am sey na the exact time wey Jesus tell am sey “your son dey alive.”. ## .
As this one happen, this rich man wey get slaves and all im family come be Jesus disciples. ## .
Na for Cana Jesus do two miracle. ## .
E first turn water to wine and from far place, e cure the small boy wey dey sick even though sey where the pikin dey far reach 26 km. ## .
No be only this miracles Jesus do. ## .
But the small boy own dey important because e show sey Jesus don come back to Galilee. ## .
Na true! Jesus na really prophet wey God anoint. ## .
But how dem go ‘respect this prophet reach for im hometown’?. ## .
We go know as Jesus dey go Nazareth. Wetin go happen to am for there?. ## .
E never reach two years wey John the Baptist tell people sey Jesus na the Lamb of God. ## .
As Jesus dey preach, people wey get better mind come be im disciples.  ## .
Andrew, Simon Peter, John, James (John brother), Philip, and Bartholomew na some of dem. ## .
E no tey, many other people come join dey follow Jesus. ## .
Jesus don ready to select im apostles. ## .
Dem go receive special training and dem go always dey with Jesus. ## .
Before Jesus select dem, e go one mountain, e fit be the one wey dey near the Sea of Galilee, wey no far from Capernaum. ## .
E use the whole night pray, dey beg God for better sense and im blessing. ## .
The next day, Jesus call im disciples and choose 12 apostles from dem. ## .
Jesus choose the six people wey we write their name for the starting. ## .
E still choose Matthew, wey e see for tax office.  ## .
The remaining five na Judas (wey be Thaddaeus and “James Son”), Simon the cananaean, Thomas, James, wey be Alphaeus son and Judas Iscariot. ## .
Jesus pray before e choose im twelve apostles. ## .
The 12 apostles don follow Jesus travel and e know dem well well. ## .
Some of dem na im relative. ## .
James and John na brothers, and dem be Jesus cousins. ## .
If wetin people dey think sey Alphaeus na Joseph brother, wey be Jesus papa for earth, e mean sey Alphaeus son wey be James go be Jesus cousin. ## .
E no dey hard Jesus to remember the names of im apostles.## .
But you go fit remember dem?. ## .
One thing wey go help person na to remember sey na two Simon dey, two James, two Judas. ## .
Simon (Peter) na Andrew brother, and James (Zebedee son), na John brother. ## .
This na one better way to remember eight name of the apostles. ## .
The other four apostles na: Tax collector (Matthew), Thomas the one wey come dey doubt, Nathanael, (na im Jesus meet under one tree) and Nathanael friend, Philip. ## .
Eleven of Jesus apostles come from Galilee wey be Jesus hometown. ## .
Nathanael come from Cana. ## .
Philip, Peter, and Andrew come from Bethsaida but later, Peter and Andrew pack go Capernaum where Matthew dey stay. ## .
James and John still dey stay near or inside Capernaum and their work na fish business. ## .
E be like sey Judas Iscariot wey sell Jesus, be the only apostle wey come from Judea. ## .
