As the prayer dey go on na so person fall yakata for bus.## .

say common sense no dey common.## . 
Dis talk na true talk. ## .
Imagine say dat girl die bicos of common asthma attack. ## .
and meanwhile our people dey there dey pray dey vibrate. ## .
Apart from wetin happen for that bus na so plenty Naija people dey live their life. ## . 
We dey put plenty power for faith yet we no dey act am. ## .
We nor dey use our sense wen we suppose. ## .
Na why our country be as e be bicos we dey fail to do di correct tings. ## .
We dey always expect miracle or wonder or say one angel go come rescue us. ## .
You go see people dey spend more time dey pray pass di time to dey do dia job. ## .
Na so one Naija nurse for Jand go dey pray for one patient. ## .
instead of make im dey do im nurse work, sotay dat patient die. ## .
My talk be say even as we dey pray make we apply our brain to wetin we dey do. ## .
Sometimes di answer dey our front but we go dey waste time dey pray. ## .
