Jesus disciples dey preach for Galilee, but the person wey prepare the road for Jesus no get that kind chance. ## .
E don almost reach two years since John the Baptist dey prison. ## .
John no fear to talk about the bad thing wey King Herod Antipas do.  ## .
Herod divorce im first wife so that e go marry Herodias wey be the wife of im half-brother, Philip. Herod dey claim sey e dey obey the Law of Moses. ## .
But the Law no support this kind marriage, and e bad for God eye. Because of wetin John talk, Herod put am for prison. ## .
E be like sey na Herodias push am to do am. ## .
Herod no know wetin e go do John, because the people see am as prophet. ## .
But Herodias know wetin to do. E get bad belle for John and the truth be sey, e dey find how e go take kill am. ## .
Last last, the chance don come. ## .
Sometime before the Passover of 32 C.E., Herod arrange one big party for im birthday. ## .
All the big men wey dey work for am, im army officers and the people wey get high position for Galilee come the party. ## .
As dem dey eat and drink, dem send Salome, the pikin wey Herodias born for Philip, make e dance for the visitors. ## .
The men really enjoy theirself because the girl dance well. ## .
Herod happy as Salome dey dance for im birthday part. ## .
Herod happy well well for wetin im step-daughter do. E come tell am sey: “Ask me anything wey you want, and I go give you. ## .
E even swear sey: “Anything wey you ask from me, I go give you, even if na half of my kingdom. ## .
Before e answer Herod, Salome come go ask im mama sey: “Wetin I go ask for?. ## .
This na the opportunity wey Herodias dey find since! Quick quick, e answer sey, “John the Baptist head. ## .
At once, Salome go back to Herod and tell am wetin e want: “I want make you give me the head of John the Baptist for tray, now now. ## .
This thing worry Herod for mind well well, but im visitors hear when e dey promise Salome.  ## .
So na shame for am if e no do as e promise. But instead make e bear the shame, e come agree to kill person wey no do anything. ## .
Herod send one of im bodyguard go the prison. E no tey, the bodyguard come back with John head for tray. E give am to Salome, and Salome carry am go give im mama. ## .
When John disciples hear wetin happen, dem come carry John body go bury. Later, dem report the matter give Jesus. ## .
Later, when Herod hear sey Jesus dey cure people and dey drive demon from people body, e come dey fear. ## .
E dey wonder whether Jesus wey dey do this miracle, na John the Baptist wey “come back to life. ## .
So, Herod Antipas come dey hungry to see Jesus. No be sey e want hear Jesus preaching. But, e want dey sure whether the thing wey dey worry am for mind na true. ## .
Jesus arrange im disciples and e tell dem better things wey go help dem for the preaching work. But no be only that one e tell dem.  ## .
E still warn dem about people wey go cause trouble for dem. E sey: ‘See! I dey send una go, like sheep wey dey with wolves. ## .
Make una dey put una eye down because people go carry una go court and flog una inside where them dey worship. ## .
And dem go carry una go front of many governor and king because of me. ## .
True true, Jesus disciples fit face serious wahala, but Jesus give dem mind and promise dem sey:. ## .
But when dem carry una go court, make una no worry about wetin una go talk or how una go talk am,. ## .
because God go give una wetin una go talk for that time; because no be una just dey talk, but na the spirit of una Father dey use una talk. ## .
Brother go kill brother, papa go kill pikin, and children go attack papa and mama and kill dem. ## .
Everybody go hate una because of my name, but na the person wey endure reach the end, go save.”. ## .
E no get any work wey get value reach the preaching work. Na im make Jesus talk sey im disciples need to use better sense, so that dem go dey free to do this work. ## .
E sey: ‘When dem suffer una for one town, make una run go another one. I dey tell una truth sey, una no go finish the whole area for the city of Israel, before the Son of man come. ## .
This na really better advice wey go help the 12 apostles get mind and use sense do the work. ## .
But we understand sey wetin Jesus talk still concern people wey go join for the preaching work after Jesus die and resurrect. ## .
We know this one because of wetin Jesus talk. E no sey na only the people wey im apostle preach to, go hate dem. But e sey “Everybody go hate” dem.  ## .
Another thing be sey, for the short time wey the apostle preach for Galilee, Bible no tell us sey dem carry dem go meet governors or kings, or sey their family people kill dem. ## .
So e clear sey na wetin go happen for front Jesus get for mind, when e dey talk this things. ## .
Think about wetin Jesus mean when e sey im disciples no go finish the preaching work ‘before Son of man come.’. ## .
This one show sey the disciples no go finish the preaching work before Jesus wey be King go come, as the judge wey God choose. ## .
If people dey cause trouble for the disciples as dem dey preach, e no suppose surprise dem. ## .
Na so because Jesus talk sey: “Person wey dey learn no pass im teacher.” Wetin Jesus talk dey  clear. ## .
People no treat am well and e face wahala as e dey preach about God Kingdom. Na so e go be for im disciples too. But Jesus tell dem sey:. ## .
“Make una no fear people wey go fit kill una body, but wey no go fit destroy una life. But make una fear the person wey go fit destroy una body and una life for Gehenna.”. ## .
Jesus really show better example for this matter. E no fear to suffer till e die, because e no want leave Jehovah, wey be the God wey get power. ## .
Na only Jehovah fit destroy person “life” (wey be im hope to get life for future). And na only im fit resurrect person make e enjoy life wey no go end. ## .
This one go don really give the apostles mind!. ## .
Jesus use one example show how God dey care for im people because e love dem. E sey: “Dem dey sell two sparrow for one coin wey get small value, no be so?. ## .
Still, one of dem no go fall for ground make your Father no know. ## .
 So no fear; una get value pass many sparrow. ## .
The things wey one disciple preach dey cause wahala for one familyy. ## .
The message wey Jesus disciples dey preach go separate family. Na true, because some people for family go accept am, and some no go accept am. ## .
Jesus talk sey: “No think sey I carry peace come the earth.” The truth be sey person wey want accept the truth need strong mind. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey: “Anybody wey get love for papa or mama pass for me no deserve me, and anybody wey get love for son or daughter pass for me no deserve me. ## .
But some people go still listen to im disciples. Jesus sey: “Anybody wey give any of this small one cold water drink, because na my disciple, no go ever lose im reward. ## .
All the things wey Jesus talk really prepare im disciples. ## .
E still help dem and give dem mind. Na im make the apostles “enter the area, from village to village dey preach the good news and dey cure people for everywhere.”. ## .
