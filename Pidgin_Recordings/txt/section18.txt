Wetin Jesus talk about, wey make this things wey e teach, dey important?. ## .
Everybody like to dey happy. ## .
Because Jesus know this one, e come first talk about things wey really dey make person happy. ## .
People go really like to listen to am well well.  ## . 
But some things go really surprise dem. ## .
E sey: ‘People wey know sey dem need God for their life go happy, because dem go get the Kingdom wey dey heaven. ## .
People wey dey cry because person die, go happy because their mind go come down. ## .
People wey dey hungry to do wetin God want, go happy because dem go belleful. ## .

One man wey no dey happy start to happy. ## .
Wetin Jesus mean when e sey “happy”?. ## .
E no dey talk about ordinary laugh or smile, like wetin person dey do when e dey enjoy imself. ## . 
Real happiness pass that one. ## .

Many people think sey na plenty money and enjoyment dey make person happy. ## .

E sey, ‘Una wey get money now go suffer because na only that one una go enjoy.  ## .
Una wey get everything now go suffer, because una go hungry. ## .
Una wey dey laugh now go suffer because una go cry and una no go happy. ## .
Una go suffer anytime wey everybody dey praise una, because na so their papa-papa praise the fake prophets dem. ## . 
One big heap of salt near the altar for God temple. ## .
Why e be sey plenty money, enjoyment, and praise from people dey bring wahala?. ## .
Na because when person get this things and value dem, e fit no remember to serve God well again. ## .
That one no go make am get real happiness. ## .
Jesus no dey talk sey poverty or hunger dey make person happy. ## .
But most times, na poor people dey obey wetin Jesus talk and na dem God dey bless with real happiness. ##
The next thing wey Jesus talk na for im disciples. ## .
E sey: “Na una be the salt for this earth.”. ## 
Jesus disciples no be ordinary salt! Dem dey put salt for some things so that dem no go quick spoil.  ## .
For God temple, dem dey keep plenty salt near the altar.  ## .
And dem dey put am for sacrifice. ## .
For Bible, salt fit still mean sey something dey pure and e no spoil.  ## .
Jesus disciples na “salt for this earth” because dem dey help people get better character and be Jehovah friend. ## .
Their message fit save anybody wey listen to dem. ## .
Lamp wey dem light and put ontop lampstand. ## .
Jesus still tell im disciple sey: ‘Na una be the light for this world.”. ## .
Person no dey use basket cover lamp, e dey put the light where e go shine. ## .
So Jesus sey: “Make una light shine for where people dey, so that dem go see una fine work and praise the Father wey dey heaven. ## .
