When some Jews talk sey Jesus dey break the Sabbath law because e cure one man, Jesus answer dem sey:. ## .
“My Father continue to dey work come reach now, and I no stop to dey work.”. ## .
God law about the Sabbath no forbid the work wey Jesus dey do.  ## .
Na God, Jesus dey copy as e dey preach and dey do miracle. ## .
Na im make Jesus continue to do good things everyday. ## .
But the answer wey Jesus give the Jew dem make dem vex more sotey dem want kill am.  ## .
Why dem vex like that?. ## .
Apart from sey, dem dey think sey Jesus dey break the Sabbath law as e dey cure people, e vex dem well well as Jesus talk sey im na God Son. ## .
Dem take am as insult to God for Jesus to call God im Father, as if Jesus dey talk sey im and God na mate. ## .
But Jesus no fear dem and e even talk about the kind special friend wey im and im Father be. ## .
Jesus talk sey:. ## .
“The Father love the Son, e show am all the things wey e do.”. ## .
Na the Father dey give life and for olden days, e give some people power to bring people wey die come life again. ## .
Jesus still talk say: . ## .
“Just as the Father dey bring people wey die come back to life, na so the Son dey bring anybody wey e want come back to life.”. ## .
Na better thing Jesus talk so and e make us get hope for front. ## .
Even now, Jesus don dey help people know God. ## .
Na im make Jesus sey:. ## .
“Anybody wey hear my word, and believe am, the Person wey send me come go give am life wey no go end. ## .
and e no go enter judgement, but e go escape death and get life.”. ## . 
Even though sey nothing show sey Jesus don bring anybody wey die come life, e let dem know sey e go happen. ## .
E talk sey: the time dey come when all the people wey dey inside grave of remembrance go hear im voice.”. ## .
As Jesus work dey important reach, e make am clear sey e no get power reach God. ## .
E talk sey: “I no fit do one single thing just by myself. ## .
because no be wetin I want I dey look for, but na wetin the person wey send me want.”. ## .
Jesus come explain the important work wey God put for im hand, something wey e never talk before for public. ## .
But this one no be the first time wey all this im enemy dey hear this truth. ## .
Jesus remind dem sey: “Una don send people go meet John, and e make the truth clear.”. ## .
Jesus enemies fit don hear am when John tell the people wey dey lead for Jew people religion. ## .
about the One wey go come after am wey dem dey call “the Prophet” and “the Christ.” . ## .
E remind dem about how dem take respect John wey dey prison now, Jesus tell dem sey:. ## . 
“na small time remain, una go ready to happy well well because of the light wey dey come from am.”. ## .
But the way Jesus explain the truth big pass John own. ## .
“The work wey my Father give me I dey do both the miracle wey e just do, and e dey show sey na the Father send me.”. ## .
Jesus still talk sey: “The Father wey send me don show many things about me.”. ## .
One example na when God talk about Jesus from heaven the time wey e baptize. ## .
The truth be sey, people wey dey talk bad about Jesus no get any reason to reject am. ## .
God Word wey dem claim sey dem know, talk about Jesus.  ## .
To end am, Jesus talk sey: “If una believe Moses, make una believe me, because e write about me. ## .
But if una no believe wetin e write, how una go take believe me?”. ## .
The people wey dey stay for the northwest side of the Sea of Galilee hear sey Jesus don come back from the Decapolis. ## .
Many of dem fit don hear how Jesus take stop the strong breeze and the wave for sea. ## .
And some fit don hear the story about the man wey Jesus drive demons from im body. ## .
Because of this one, plenty people come gather near the sea to welcome Jesus. ## .
E be like sey na for Capernaum area this people gather.  ## .
As Jesus dey come down from the boat, the people come dey hungry to see the things wey e go do. ## .
E get one man wey still dey wait to see Jesus. ## .
Na big man e be for synagogue, im name na Jairus.  ## .
E kneel down for Jesus front and e come beg am plenty times sey:. ## .
“My daughter dey sick well well. ## .
Abeg come put your hand ontop am make e well again, make e no die.”. ## .
Jairus really love this im daughter wey dey 12 years. ## .
And na im be the only pikin wey e get. Jesus go listen to this man and help the pikin?. ## .
As Jesus dey go Jairus house, e come see another thing wey touch am. ## .
Many of the people wey dey follow Jesus dey hungry to see if Jesus go do any miracle for their front. ## .
But one woman among dem dey think about the bad sickness wey e get. ## .
This woman na Jew person, and for 12 good years, blood dey flow from im body. ## .
E don meet many doctors, and e don spend all im money for different medicine. ## .
But instead of am to dey well, the sickness “come bad pass before.”. ## .
This kind thing no go only make the woman body weak. ## .
Shame go still dey catch am because of im condition.  ## .
This kind thing no be wetin person go like to talk about for where many people dey. ## .
And for the Law wey Jehovah give Moses, when blood dey flow from woman body, the woman no go dey clean for some time. ## .
And if anybody touch the woman or the cloth wey the blood stain, that person must wash im body, and e no go dey clean till evening. ## .
This woman don hear many things about Jesus, and e want meet am.  ## .
But the woman no want make people notice am because of im sickness. ## .
So e come dey pass inside the crowd small small so that dem no go notice am, and e tell imself sey if e just touch Jesus outer garment, e go well. ## .
As e touch the corner of Jesus cloth, the woman come notice sey the flow of blood don stop!. ## .
This bad sickness don go. ## .
Jesus come sey; “Who touch me?” How you think sey the woman feel when e hear wetin Jesus talk?. ## .
Peter come tell Jesus sey: “People surround you and gather you.”. ## .
But why Jesus dey find who touch am? Jesus talk sey:. ## .
“Somebody touch me, because I know sey power comot from my body.”. ## .
True true, as the woman heal, e draw Jesus power. ## .
As the woman know sey Jesus notice wetin happen, e come kneel down for Jesus front, dey shake because of fear. ## .
E start to talk the truth about im sickness for everybody front, and sey the sickness don go. ## .
Jesus tell the woman wetin go make im mind come down. ## .
E tell am sey: ‘My daughter, your faith don make you well. ## .
Go, no worry and make your bad sickness no disturb you again.’. ## .
E clear sey Jesus wey God choose to rule this earth na person wey get love and soft mind for people. ## .
Jesus no only dey care about people, but e still get power to help dem!. ## .
