Jesus don dey preach for about two years now. ## .
Time don reach for am to slow down or relax? For where! Jesus even dey preach more more. ## .
E start to “dey waka round all the city and village, dey teach for their synagogue and dey preach the good news about the Kingdom. ## .
and dey cure all kind of disease and all kind of sickness. ## .
Wetin Jesus see make am believe sey the preaching work suppose reach more people. ## .
But how e go take do am? .##.
As Jesus dey travel, e see sey many people need to hear the truth from God Word wey go help dem and make their mind come down. ## .
The people just dey suffer like sheep wey no get shepherd. Jesus pity for dem and e tell im disciples sey:. ## .
“True true, things to harvest plenty, but the workers small. ## .
So, beg the Master of the harvest to send workers come im harvest. ## .
Jesus disciples dey preach about God Kingdom from house to house. ## .
Jesus know wetin go make the work move. E gather the 12 apostles and e share dem two two. ## .
So dem come be six group of people wey go dey preach. E tell dem how dem go do the work. ## .
E sey: “Make una no enter the road of the nation and make una no enter any Samaritan town;. ## .
but, make una continue to find the lost sheep for the house of Israel.  ## .
As una dey go, make una preach sey: ‘The Kingdom wey dey heaven don near. ## .
Na which Kingdom dem go preach about? Na the one wey Jesus talk about when e teach people how to pray. ## .
When Jesus sey ‘the Kingdom  don near,’ wetin e mean? E mean sey Jesus Christ wey go be King of that Kingdom dey with dem. ## .
But how the disciples go take show sey dem dey work for this Kingdom? Jesus give dem power to cure sick people and even bring people wey don die back to life. ## .
And e go be free. But how the apostles go take get things like food, wey dem need?. ## .
Jesus tell im disciples make dem no prepare things wey dem go carry as dem dey go preach. E sey make dem no carry gold, silver, or copper for their purse. ## .
Dem no even need to carry bag wey dem go put food, or extra cloth or sandals. ## .
Why? Jesus promise dem sey who dey work must chop. ## .
The people wey like the message go give the disciples wetin dem really need. Jesus still sey:. ## 
“Any house wey una enter, make una stay there until una comot for the place. ## .
How the disciples go take preach the message about the Kingdom to people? Jesus tell dem sey:. ##
“When una enter any house, greet the people wey dey there. ## .
If the people ready to listen, make the peace wey una carry come, dey with dem. ## .
But if dem no want to listen, make the peace wey una carry come, return to una. ## .
Anywhere wey dem no welcome una or listen to una, as una dey comot from that house or town, make una shake the dust comot from una leg. ## .
E fit even be sey one full town or village go reject the message. ## .
Wetin go happen to that place? Jesus talk wetin show sey dem go get heavy judgment. ## .
E sey: “True true, I dey tell una sey e go dey more easy for Sodom and Gomorrah for Judgment Day pass that city. ## .
Jesus arrange im disciples and e tell dem better things wey go help dem for the preaching work. But no be only that one e tell dem. ## .
E still warn dem about people wey go cause trouble for dem. E sey: ‘See! I dey send una go, like sheep wey dey with wolves. ## .
Make una dey put una eye down because people go carry una go court and flog una inside where them dey worship. ## .  
And dem go carry una go front of many governor and king because of me. ## .
True true, Jesus disciples fit face serious wahala, but Jesus give dem mind and promise dem sey:. ## .
“But when dem carry una go court, make una no worry about wetin una go talk or how una go talk am, because God go give una wetin una go talk for that time;. ## .
because no be una just dey talk, but na the spirit of una Father dey use una talk. ## .
Brother go kill brother, papa go kill pikin, and children go attack papa and mama and kill dem. ## .
Everybody go hate una because of my name, but na the person wey endure reach the end, go save. ## .
E no get any work wey get value reach the preaching work. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey im disciples need to use better sense, so that dem go dey free to do this work. ## .
E sey: ‘When dem suffer una for one town, make una run go another one. ## .
I dey tell una truth sey, una no go finish the whole area for the city of Israel, before the Son of man come. ## .
This na really better advice wey go help the 12 apostles get mind and use sense do the work. ## .
But we understand sey wetin Jesus talk still concern people wey go join for the preaching work after Jesus die and resurrect. ## .
We know this one because of wetin Jesus talk. E no sey na only the people wey im apostle preach to, go hate dem. ## .
But e sey “Everybody go hate” dem. ## .
Another thing be sey, for the short time wey the apostle preach for Galilee, Bible no tell us sey dem carry dem go meet governors or kings, or sey their family people kill dem. ## .
So e clear sey na wetin go happen for front Jesus get for mind, when e dey talk this things. ## .
Think about wetin Jesus mean when e sey im disciples no go finish the preaching work ‘before Son of man come. ## .
This one show sey the disciples no go finish the preaching work before Jesus wey be King go come, as the judge wey God choose. ## .
If people dey cause trouble for the disciples as dem dey preach, e no suppose surprise dem. Na so because Jesus talk sey:. ## .
“Person wey dey learn no pass im teacher.” Wetin Jesus talk dey  clear. People no treat am well and e face wahala as e dey preach about God Kingdom. ## .
Na so e go be for im disciples too. But Jesus tell dem sey: “Make una no fear people wey go fit kill una body, but wey no go fit destroy una life. ## .
But make una fear the person wey go fit destroy una body and una life for Gehenna. ## .
Jesus really show better example for this matter. E no fear to suffer till e die, because e no want leave Jehovah, wey be the God wey get power. ## .
Na only Jehovah fit destroy person “life” (wey be im hope to get life for future). And na only im fit resurrect person make e enjoy life wey no go end. ## .
This one go don really give the apostles mind!. ## .
Jesus use one example show how God dey care for im people because e love dem. ## .
E sey: “Dem dey sell two sparrow for one coin wey get small value, no be so? Still, one of dem no go fall for ground make your Father no know. ## .
So no fear; una get value pass many sparrow. ## .
The things wey one disciple preach dey cause wahala for one familyy. ## .
The message wey Jesus disciples dey preach go separate family. Na true, because some people for family go accept am, and some no go accept am. ## .
Jesus talk sey: “No think sey I carry peace come the earth.” The truth be sey person wey want accept the truth need strong mind. ## .
Na im make Jesus talk sey: “Anybody wey get love for papa or mama pass for me no deserve me, and anybody wey get love for son or daughter pass for me no deserve me. ## .
But some people go still listen to im disciples. Jesus sey: “Anybody wey give any of this small one cold water drink, because na my disciple, no go ever lose im reward.## .
All the things wey Jesus talk really prepare im disciples. ## .
E still help dem and give dem mind. Na im make the apostles “enter the area, from village to village dey preach the good news and dey cure people for everywhere. ## .
